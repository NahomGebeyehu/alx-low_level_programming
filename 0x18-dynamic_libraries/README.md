##  Requirements
*   Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`.
*   All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`.
*   Your code should use the `Betty` style. It will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`.
*   All your files should end with a new line.
*   You are not allowed to use global variables.
*   No more than 5 functions per file.
*   You are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like `printf`, `puts`, etc… is forbidden.
*   You are allowed to use [_putchar](https://github.com/holbertonschool/_putchar.c/blob/master/_putchar.c).
*   The `main.c` files are used to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo.
*   The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called `main.h`.
*   All your header files should be include guarded.


## Project Description
Learn about what is a dynamic library, how does it work, how to create one, and how to use it.
What is the environment variable `$LD_LIBRARY_PATH` and how to use it.
What are the differences between static and shared libraries.
Basic usage `nm`, `ldd`, `ldconfig`.

* **0. A library is not a luxury but one of the necessities of life** - Create the dynamic library `libdynamic.so` containing all the functions listed. - `libdynamic.so`, `main.h`.
* **1. Without libraries what have we? We have no past and no future** - Create a script that creates a dynamic library called `liball.so` from all the `.c` files that are in the current directory. - `1-create_dynamic_lib.sh`.
* **2. Let's call C functions from Python** - Create a dynamic library that contains C functions that can be called from Python. See example for more detail. - `100-operations.so`.
* **3. Code injection: Win the Giga Millions!** - I bought a ticket for the Giga Millions and chose these numbers: 9, 8, 10, 24, 75 + 9. If you could run two commands on the same server where the Giga Millions program runs, could you make me win the Jackpot? - `101-make_me_win.sh`.
